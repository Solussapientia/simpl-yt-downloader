## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. **Initialize Git (if not already done)**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - YouTube downloader ready for Railway"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   # Create a new repo on GitHub first, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

2. **Create New Project**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your YouTube downloader repository
   - Click "Deploy Now"

3. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Railway will automatically detect your Python app
   - It will install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Use the configuration from `railway.toml`
   - Deploy using Gunicorn as specified in `Procfile`

### Step 3: Configure Your App

1. **Generate Domain**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to your project
   - Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app.railway.app`

2. **Environment Variables (Optional)**
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add any custom environment variables if needed
   - Railway automatically provides `PORT` variable

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Monitor the build process
   - Look for any errors in the logs

2. **Expected Build Process**
   ```
   Building...
   âœ… Installing Python 3.9
   âœ… Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
   âœ… Starting with Gunicorn
   âœ… App running on Railway-provided port
   ```

### Step 5: Test Your App

1. **Visit Your App**
   - Open your Railway-provided URL
   - Should see your YouTube downloader interface

2. **Test Functionality**
   - Try downloading a YouTube video
   - Check if yt-dlp works correctly
   - Verify file downloads work

## ðŸ“Š Railway Configuration Details

### `railway.toml` Configuration

```toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[deploy.env]
PYTHONUNBUFFERED = "1"
PYTHONPATH = "/app"
```

### `Procfile` Alternative

```
web: gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app
```

### App Configuration

```python
# app.py automatically detects Railway PORT
port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8000))
app.run(debug=False, host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   ```
   Error: Could not find requirements.txt
   Solution: Ensure requirements.txt is in root directory
   ```

2. **App Won't Start**
   ```
   Error: No module named 'yt_dlp'
   Solution: Check requirements.txt has yt-dlp==2024.12.13
   ```

3. **Port Issues**
   ```
   Error: App not responding
   Solution: Verify PORT environment variable usage in app.py
   ```

4. **yt-dlp Not Working**
   ```
   Error: yt-dlp command not found
   Solution: Railway automatically installs Python packages
   ```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Connect to Railway shell
railway shell

# Check environment variables
railway variables
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Post-Deployment

### 1. Custom Domain (Optional)

```bash
# Add custom domain in Railway dashboard
# Settings â†’ Domains â†’ Add Custom Domain
# Configure DNS: CNAME record pointing to Railway
```

### 2. Environment Variables

```bash
# Add in Railway dashboard under Variables tab
DEBUG=False
FLASK_ENV=production
```

### 3. Monitoring
